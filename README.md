# 🏡 Homestay-Booking-System-Using-MongoDB

## 📌 Project Overview

**Homestay Connect** is a backend database system designed for a homestay booking platform where travelers can connect with local hosts offering short-term stays. This project models the core functionality of platforms like Airbnb using MongoDB, focusing on the seamless management of users, hosts, rooms, bookings, and payments.

The database is structured using multiple collections to store and organize data such as customer profiles, host listings, room availability, booking details, reviews, and transactions. It showcases real-world use cases through sample data and essential backend operations such as booking a room, cancelling a reservation, vacating a room, and submitting reviews.

MongoDB's flexible schema design allows the system to scale efficiently, handle varied types of data, and maintain relationships using `ObjectId` references. This makes it a practical solution for startups or developers building travel and tourism-related applications.
